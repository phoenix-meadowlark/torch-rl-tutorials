# Reinforcement Learning Tutorials in Torch
This repository contains implementation focused tutorials for reinforcement learning algorithms. Currently I am only working on a tutorial for simple policy gradient optimization, however I may cover more of the basics in the future.

The main take-away from this should be defining your own loss functions in torch to update a neural network based off of semi-supervised data. Knowing this will allow you to implement other algorithms that use different objectives.
